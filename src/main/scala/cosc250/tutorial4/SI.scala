     In this tutorial, we'll play around with implicits to see if we can get
     an equation for Volts, Watts, Amps, and Ohms working.

     SI units is actually quite a hard problem, so we're not going to go very far.
     We're just going to get the equation from the lecture working.

     First, we'll do an example with prefixes (eg, "milli" for thousandths), where
     I've provided the class but not the implicit conversion function.

     Then we'll do one that sets up equations with units -- I've written the
     machinery for handling the units, but you'll need to define a class and an
     implicit conversion so that you can make things like
     3.pico.Watts
     compile

  /*
     Part 3: Here's one someone else made earlier.

     In our code, to keep things short, all unit measurements are of type WithUnits.
     So, 1.Volt + 2.Amps gives an error at runtime.

     But we could create types for Volts, Amps, etc, so this would be checked statically
     at compile time.

     That's probably too long an exercise for a tutorial -- there would be a lot of
     different unit combinations, so let's just demo one someone else made earlier

     This is scoped inside a block to prevent the import from leaking into the other
     work.
